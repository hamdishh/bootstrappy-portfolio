# Unit 3 Challenge: Code Bootstrap Portfolio

## Description
A portfolio webpage showcasing projects to future employers using bootstrap 5 components and utility classes. Components I've added is a skills section, navigation bar with links that have a hover effect and a drop down menu, bootstrap cards with placeholder imagery to display projects.

## Code highlights/What i learned during the challenge
The contact me link section of navbar was originally just a dropdown menu on my bootstrap that i wanted to get rid of so after some modifications using bootstrap utlity classes i made it a regular navlink such as the about and home section that would direct to my footer social media icons instead.
